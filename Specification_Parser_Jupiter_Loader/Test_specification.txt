	Params: 
		Type : Calculation
		Functions : ["e^x", "x^n", "sin(x)", "log(x)"]
		Graphs : []
		Constants : [1, 2]
		Points : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

	Statement: 
		Given function $f(x) = {} $, compute its 
		derivative $f'(x)$ at point $x={}$.

	Solution: 
		Recall the formula for differentiating $f(x) = {}$: $$f'(x) = {}.$$ 
		Then plug in $x = {}$ to get $f'({}) = {}$.
